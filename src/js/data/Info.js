        I'm Self-taught React.js/Front-end Developer.

        <br />I build modern-day UI components to improve application
        performance.
        <br />
        <br />I spend most of my time writing code for building User Interfaces.
        I like enjoying working in the intersection of design and development. I
        feel most productive when I'm able to design User Interfaces which not
        only look good but has a good performance as well.
